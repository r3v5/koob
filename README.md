★ The aim of this assignment is to develop a book reservation web site using PHP, MySQL database and Apache Web Server. The application will allow users to search for and reserve library books.
Specifically, the application will enable the following:

Library functionality- the users should be allowed to:
- Search for a book
- Reserve a book
- View all the books that they have reserved:
- Login
- Registration
- Logout
- Session authentication via Cookies
- Search for a book
- The results of the search should display as a list from which the user can then reserve a
book if available. If the book is already reserved, the user should not be allowed to
reserve the book.
- Reserve a book – The system should allow a user to reserve a book provided that no-one
else has reserved the book yet. The reservation functionality should capture the date on
which the reservation was made.
- View reserved books – the system should allow the user to see a list of the book(s)
currently reserved by that user. User should be able to remove the reservation as well.
